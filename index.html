	<h2>The Story</h2>
		<p>We have fourteen hens, twelve eggs a day are more than we can handle. I remember when my wife first asked about raising chickens. It didn't seem like a serious request. As of August 2013, we established our coop and have what I like to call, 'eggs out the yin yang.' I hope that we get the chance to share them with you.</p>
